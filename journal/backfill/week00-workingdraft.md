# 🚧 Obstacles & How I Solved Them

### **1. Understanding correct root cleanup**
I had questions about removing credentials vs. disabling them.  
**Solution:** Verified via AWS docs that the root account should have *no access keys* at all and must have MFA.

### **2. Billing alerts confusing at first**
Different screens for Budgets vs Billing Alarms.  
**Solution:** Followed the class video to create both — Budget thresholds + CloudWatch Alarm.

### **3. Lucidchart AWS shapes not visible**
**Solution:** Enabled AWS shape library manually under “Shapes”.
