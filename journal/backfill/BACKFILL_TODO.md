# Backfill Tasks


## High Priority

- Practice Markdown several times in `markdown_playground.md`
- Re-read Andrew's Markdown/journal video and copy at least 2–3 patterns
- Make sure Week 0 journal clearly shows:
  - Proof of AWS CLI work
  - Proof of billing alert/budget
  - Proof of architecture diagram
  - A short note that I practiced Markdown (pointing to this backfill folder)

## Nice-To-Have

- Try a small table in Markdown
- Try a fenced code block with a language tag (```json, ```bash, etc.)
